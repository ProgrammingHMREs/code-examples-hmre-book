## Chapter 2 | Exercises

1. Search the AMD GPU Compute Architecture and describe the main hardware components.


2. Highlight the key differences in the GPU compute architecture between the latest NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD GPU microarchitectures.

 
3. What are the implications of sharing hardware functional units on GPUs, especially when running applications with FP64, or any other special math functions (SFU) units?


4. List examples of software applications and domains that are utilizing GPUs to provide higher performance. To do so, scan the CUDA, OpenCL, and oneAPI websites to find use cases. What do they have in common?


5. What are the implications in performance of control flow divergence on commodity GPUs?

   a. What are the best and worst case scenarios?
   
   b. Is there any strategy to increase performance when control flow divergence is present?
